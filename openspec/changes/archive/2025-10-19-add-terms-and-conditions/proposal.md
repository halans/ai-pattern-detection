# Add Terms and Conditions Page

**Change ID:** add-terms-and-conditions
**Status:** Draft
**Author:** AI Assistant
**Date:** 2025-10-19

## Summary

Add a Terms and Conditions page to the Slop Detector web application with typical legal content relevant to the use of the service. The page will be accessible via a footer link labeled "T&C" to maintain a compact footer design.

## Problem Statement

The Slop Detector currently has a Privacy Policy page but lacks Terms and Conditions (T&C) that define:
- **Acceptable use** of the service
- **Service limitations and disclaimers** (e.g., accuracy is not guaranteed)
- **Intellectual property rights** for the patterns and analysis engine
- **Liability limitations** for decisions made based on analysis results
- **User responsibilities** when using the tool

**Legal and operational risks:**
- Without T&C, users may have unrealistic expectations about detection accuracy
- No clear disclaimer that results should not be solely relied upon for consequential decisions
- Lack of protection against misuse or automated abuse of the service
- No defined terms for API usage or integration

## Goals

- Create a `/terms` route with a Terms and Conditions page
- Include standard T&C sections relevant to Slop Detector:
  - Acceptance of Terms
  - Description of Service
  - Acceptable Use Policy
  - Accuracy Disclaimer
  - Intellectual Property
  - Limitation of Liability
  - Changes to Terms
- Add a "T&C" link in the footer (short form to save space)
- Match the design and accessibility patterns from the Privacy Policy page
- Support client-side routing like the Privacy Policy

## Non-Goals

- Creating legally binding contracts (this is informational guidance)
- Requiring user acceptance or sign-in
- Implementing terms version tracking or acceptance logging
- Adding T&C to the browser extension (web app only for now)
- Creating a separate route for each T&C section

## User Stories

1. **As a user**, I want to understand the terms of using Slop Detector so I know what's expected and what limitations exist.

2. **As a content reviewer**, I want to see disclaimers about accuracy so I understand not to rely solely on the tool for high-stakes decisions.

3. **As a developer integrating the API**, I want to review acceptable use policies to ensure my usage complies with the terms.

4. **As an operator**, I want legal protection through clearly stated terms that limit liability and define acceptable use.

## Proposed Solution

### 1. Create TermsAndConditions Component

Follow the pattern from `PrivacyPolicy.tsx`:
- Create `frontend/src/pages/TermsAndConditions.tsx`
- Use semantic HTML with proper headings (h1, h2, h3)
- Apply consistent styling matching the privacy policy
- Ensure accessibility (keyboard navigation, ARIA, readable contrast)

### 2. Add Routing Support

Update `App.tsx` view state:
- Add `'terms'` as a valid view option
- Handle `/terms` pathname in URL matching
- Render `<TermsAndConditions />` component when view is 'terms'

### 3. Add Footer Link

Update footer in `App.tsx`:
- Add "T&C" link after "Privacy Policy" with same separator pattern
- Use same link styling and onClick handler for client-side routing
- Keep text short ("T&C") as requested

### Example Footer Structure
```tsx
<a href="/privacy" onClick={(e) => { e.preventDefault(); setView('privacy'); }}>
  Privacy Policy
</a>
&nbsp;â€¢&nbsp;
<a href="/terms" onClick={(e) => { e.preventDefault(); setView('terms'); }}>
  T&C
</a>
```

## Terms and Conditions Content Outline

**1. Acceptance of Terms**
- By using Slop Detector, users agree to these terms
- If you don't agree, don't use the service

**2. Description of Service**
- Pattern-based AI content detection tool
- Analyzes text using linguistic patterns
- Provides classification and confidence score
- Free to use, no registration required

**3. Acceptable Use Policy**
- Use for legitimate content analysis only
- No automated abuse, scraping, or excessive API calls
- No attempt to reverse-engineer the pattern detection logic
- No use for harassment or malicious purposes

**4. Accuracy and Limitations Disclaimer**
- Results are probabilistic, not definitive proof
- False positives and false negatives can occur
- Should not be solely relied upon for consequential decisions
- Academic writing may be incorrectly flagged
- No guarantee of accuracy or reliability

**5. Intellectual Property**
- Pattern detection engine and algorithms are proprietary
- Open-source components used under their respective licenses
- Results generated by the tool belong to the user

**6. Privacy and Data Handling**
- Refer to Privacy Policy for data practices
- Zero data retention policy
- All processing is ephemeral

**7. Limitation of Liability**
- Service provided "as is" without warranties
- Not liable for decisions made based on results
- Not responsible for damages from service use or unavailability
- No guarantee of uptime or availability

**8. Service Modifications**
- Right to modify, suspend, or discontinue service at any time
- No obligation to maintain specific features or accuracy levels
- Pattern updates may change results over time

**9. Changes to Terms**
- Terms may be updated periodically
- Continued use constitutes acceptance of updated terms
- Last updated date will be displayed

**10. Contact and Governing Law**
- Contact information for questions
- Informal dispute resolution
- No arbitration clauses (keep simple)

## Technical Approach

1. **Create component file:** `frontend/src/pages/TermsAndConditions.tsx`
   - Import from App.tsx
   - Export default function component
   - Structure with semantic HTML

2. **Update App.tsx:**
   - Add 'terms' to view state type
   - Add /terms pathname checking in useEffect
   - Add TermsAndConditions component to conditional rendering
   - Add footer link with onClick handler

3. **Match existing patterns:**
   - Same styling as PrivacyPolicy
   - Glass panel effect for consistency
   - Proper heading hierarchy
   - Accessible link focus states

## Success Metrics

- T&C page loads without errors at `/terms` route
- Footer link navigates to T&C page correctly
- Client-side routing works (no page reload)
- Page is accessible (WCAG AA compliance)
- Consistent styling with Privacy Policy
- No breaking changes to existing routes

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Legal accuracy of terms | Use standard boilerplate adapted for Slop Detector; user can review/modify |
| Footer link too short/unclear | "T&C" is standard abbreviation; tooltip could be added if needed |
| Route conflicts | `/terms` is unique and follows same pattern as `/privacy` |
| Accessibility issues | Follow same patterns as Privacy Policy (already accessible) |

## Dependencies

None - standalone frontend change following existing patterns.

## Backward Compatibility

**Breaking change:** NO

**Impact:**
- Purely additive (new page and link)
- Existing routes and functionality unchanged
- No changes to API or backend
- Browser extension unaffected

## Future Considerations

- Add T&C to browser extension if it becomes a paid product
- Version tracking for terms changes
- User acceptance flow if registration is added
- Separate API terms if API becomes public
- Internationalization for non-English markets
