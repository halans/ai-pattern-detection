# Change Proposal: Add Clear Text Button

**Change ID:** `add-text-clear-button`  
**Author:** Codex  
**Date:** 2025-10-14  
**Status:** Draft

---

## Why

Users currently have no quick way to reset the main text input after pasting or typing content. Manually selecting and deleting large blocks of text is tedious and slows down iterative analysis. Providing an explicit control improves usability and mirrors the affordances users expect from text analysis tools.

---

## What Changes

- **NEW**: Add a dedicated “Clear” button alongside the primary text input controls on the frontend.
- **NEW**: Disable the button when the textarea is empty to avoid redundant interaction.
- **NEW**: On click, clear the textarea contents and reset any pending validation errors or results tied to the current text.

---

## Impact

### Affected Specs
- **MODIFIED** `specs/frontend-ui/` – Text input controls gain a clear/reset action and state rules.

### Affected Code
- Frontend React components that render and manage the text input (`TextInput`, parent state handlers).
- Frontend state management for pending analysis results and validation messages.

### Infrastructure
- No infrastructure changes required.

---

## Success Criteria

- Clear button only renders in an enabled state when the textarea contains characters.
- Clicking the button empties the textarea and clears local state (errors/results) within 100ms.
- Keyboard and screen-reader users can discover and activate the control (button element with accessible label).

---

## Dependencies

- Existing frontend state management for the textarea value and analysis results.
- No external library or backend dependencies.

---

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Clearing text accidentally discards work | Require explicit button press; keep button disabled until text exists |
| Inconsistent state reset (e.g., lingering results) | Centralize clear logic so both text and derived state are reset together |

---

## Open Questions

- [ ] Should the clear action also reset uploaded file state once file analysis is implemented?
