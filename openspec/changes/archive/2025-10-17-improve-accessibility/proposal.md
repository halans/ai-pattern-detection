# Change Proposal: Improve Accessibility and Keyboard Navigation

**Change ID:** `improve-accessibility`
**Author:** Codex
**Date:** 2025-10-16  
**Status:** Draft

---

## Why

The current UI relies heavily on mouse interaction and may not provide sufficient semantic cues (focus states, ARIA labels) for screen readers and keyboard-only users. To make the analyzer broadly usable—including users with disabilities and fast power users—we need to ensure full keyboard navigation, clear focus indicators, and accessible component semantics.

---

## What Changes

- **NEW** global keyboard navigation plan: every actionable element reachable via Tab/Shift+Tab; intuitive order matching visual layout.
- **UPDATED** focus management: visible focus rings, skip-to-content link, focus traps for dialogs/modals.
- **UPDATED** semantics: use ARIA roles/labels where native elements are insufficient (e.g., pattern tables, export buttons), ensure headings hierarchy is logical.
- **UPDATED** frontend tests to include axe/ARIA checks where feasible.
- **OPTIONAL** support for keyboard shortcuts (e.g., focus textarea, trigger analyze) if discovered during design.

---

## Impact

### Affected Specs
- **MODIFIED** `specs/frontend-ui/` – navigation order, focus behavior, accessibility requirements.
- **MODIFIED** `specs/reporting/` or UI spec to ensure results sections have accessible tables/lists and descriptive names.

### Affected Code
- Frontend components (inputs, buttons, results view, export controls) for tabindex, focus styling, aria-labels.
- Possibly introduction of accessibility testing utilities (jest-axe, storybook a11y, etc.).

### Infrastructure
- No backend changes. Potential addition of lint/test tools for accessibility in CI.

---

## Success Criteria

- Entire workflow (input, upload, analyze, exports) is usable without a mouse.
- Screen readers announce key UI segments (results sections, pattern lists) accurately.
- Accessibility audit (manual or automated) reports contrast, keyboard, and ARIA issues resolved.

---

## Dependencies

- Existing frontend component structure.
- Potential adoption of accessibility testing library.

---

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Visual regressions due to focus styles | Coordinate with design, use consistent focus indicators |
| Additional complexity in components | Refactor components for clarity, document focus flows |
| Accessibility audit reveals deeper issues | Prioritize major blockers first, document follow-ups |

## Open Questions

- [ ] Should we add keyboard shortcuts beyond tab navigation (e.g., pressing `a` focuses the analyze button)?
- [ ] Do we need to support screen reader announcements for dynamic updates (e.g., results ready) via live regions?
- [ ] Should we add high-contrast mode toggles or rely on OS/browser-level settings?
