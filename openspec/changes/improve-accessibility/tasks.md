# Implementation Tasks: Improve Accessibility and Keyboard Navigation

## 1. Audit & Planning
- [ ] 1.1 Map current tab order, focusable elements, and heading structure.
- [ ] 1.2 Identify missing ARIA labels/roles and components requiring semantic upgrades.
- [ ] 1.3 Decide on accessibility testing approach (e.g., Jest + axe, manual audit checklist).

## 2. Frontend Implementation
- [ ] 2.1 Ensure all interactive elements (buttons, links, inputs) are reachable via keyboard with logical tab order.
- [ ] 2.2 Add visible focus styles consistent across light/dark themes.
- [ ] 2.3 Implement skip-to-content link and ensure focus management when results render.
- [ ] 2.4 Add ARIA labels/descriptions to complex UI (pattern tables, metadata sections, export buttons).
- [ ] 2.5 Optionally add keyboard shortcuts for primary actions if scope allows.

## 3. Testing & Validation
- [ ] 3.1 Add automated accessibility tests (e.g., jest-axe) for key components/pages.
- [ ] 3.2 Conduct manual keyboard walk-through to verify navigation order and focus states.
- [ ] 3.3 Run screen reader spot checks to ensure headings and announcements make sense.

## 4. Documentation & Follow-up
- [ ] 4.1 Update README or internal docs summarizing accessibility guarantees and keyboard usage.
- [ ] 4.2 Log any remaining issues/out-of-scope improvements for future work.
