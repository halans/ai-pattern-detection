- **THEN** the system optionally includes code content or excludes it based on configuration

#### Scenario: Front matter stripping
- **WHEN** Markdown contains YAML/TOML front matter
- **THEN** the system strips metadata and processes only body content

---

### Requirement: Ephemeral File Processing
The system SHALL process uploaded files in memory without persistent storage.

#### Scenario: In-memory processing
- **WHEN** file is uploaded successfully
- **THEN** the system processes the file entirely in memory/volatile storage
- **AND** no copy is written to disk or object storage

#### Scenario: Immediate cleanup
- **WHEN** analysis is completed or fails
- **THEN** the system immediately discards all file data from memory
- **AND** no file traces remain

#### Scenario: Privacy guarantee
- **WHEN** user uploads a file
- **THEN** the system guarantees zero retention of file content
- **AND** no logging of file content occurs

---

### Requirement: Character Count Validation
The system SHALL enforce character limits on extracted text.

#### Scenario: Text within limits
- **WHEN** extracted text contains 100-20,000 characters
- **THEN** the system proceeds with analysis

#### Scenario: Extracted text too long
- **WHEN** extracted text exceeds 20,000 characters
