# Pattern Registry Update v1.1.0

**Date:** 2025-10-14
**Update Type:** Feature Enhancement
**Pattern Engine:** v1.0.0 â†’ v1.1.0

---

## Summary

Added **5 new detection patterns** to the pattern registry, expanding coverage from 16 to **21 total patterns**. All new patterns follow established severity classifications and weighting system.

---

## New Patterns Added

### MEDIUM Severity (5 points each)

#### 1. worth-mentioning
- **Description**: Editorializing phrase for emphasis
- **Regex**: `/worth mentioning/gi`
- **Examples**:
  - "worth mentioning that"
  - "it is worth mentioning"
- **Rationale**: Common AI phrase for introducing additional information

#### 2. profound-legacy
- **Description**: Cultural heritage clichÃ© about lasting impact
- **Regex**: `/profound legacy/gi`
- **Examples**:
  - "profound legacy of"
  - "left a profound legacy"
- **Rationale**: Overused phrase in AI-generated historical/cultural content

#### 3. broken-citation
- **Description**: Placeholder citations
- **Regex**: `/\[(citation needed|source)\]/gi`
- **Examples**:
  - "[citation needed]"
  - "[source]"
- **Rationale**: AI sometimes includes placeholder citation markers

#### 4. emoji-heading
- **Description**: Emoji characters in markdown-style headings
- **Regex**: `/^#+\s+.*[\u{1F600}-\u{1F64F}\u{1F300}-\u{1F5FF}\u{1F680}-\u{1F6FF}\u{2600}-\u{26FF}\u{2700}-\u{27BF}]/gmu`
- **Examples**:
  - "# ðŸŽ¯ Getting Started"
  - "## ðŸš€ Features"
- **Rationale**: AI tends to use emojis in headings for visual appeal

### LOW Severity (2 points each)

#### 5. title-case-heading
- **Description**: Excessive title case in headings
- **Regex**: `/^#+\s+([A-Z][a-z]+\s+){3,}/gm`
- **Examples**:
  - "# The Complete Guide To Modern Development"
  - "## Best Practices For Writing Code"
- **Rationale**: AI often uses formal title case in all headings

#### 6. em-dash-spam
- **Description**: Excessive use of em-dashes
- **Regex**: `/(â€”.*){3,}/g`
- **Examples**:
  - "textâ€”more textâ€”even moreâ€”and more"
- **Rationale**: Some AI models overuse em-dashes for connecting clauses

## Updated Pattern Count

### By Severity:
- **CRITICAL** (20 points): 2 patterns
- **HIGH** (10 points): 8 patterns
- **MEDIUM** (5 points): 7 patterns (+5 new)
- **LOW** (2 points): 4 patterns (+1 new)

**Total: 21 patterns** (was 16)

1. **`backend/src/patterns/registry.ts`**
   - Added 6 new pattern definitions
   - Updated `PATTERN_ENGINE_VERSION` to `1.1.0`
   - Added ~40 lines of code

   - Expanded pattern descriptions with new examples
   - Added new patterns to categorized lists

3. **`backend/README.md`**

   - Added new pattern examples to bullet list
   - Updated footer with new version number
   - Changed footer text to show "Pattern Engine v1.1.0 (21 patterns)"

## Scoring Impact

With the addition of 5 new MEDIUM patterns and 1 new LOW pattern:

### Maximum Possible Score (theoretical):
- If all patterns trigger once: 2Ã—20 + 8Ã—10 + 7Ã—5 + 4Ã—2 = 40 + 80 + 35 + 8 = **163 points**
- Normalized to 100: **100 points** (AI-generated)

### Typical Score Increases:
- Texts with emoji headings: +5 points
- Texts with title case headings: +2 points
- Texts with broken citations: +5 points
- Texts with "profound legacy": +5 points
- Texts with "worth mentioning": +5 points
- Texts with excessive em-dashes: +2 points

### Classification Thresholds (unchanged):
- 0-30: Likely Human-written
- 31-69: Mixed/Uncertain
- 70-100: Likely AI-generated

## Testing Recommendations

To validate the new patterns, test with:

### Test Case 1: Emoji Headings
```markdown
# ðŸŽ¯ Getting Started

This guide will help you get started quickly.

## ðŸš€ Features

Here are the main features...
```
**Expected:** Should detect `emoji-heading` pattern (2 matches)

### Test Case 2: Broken Citations
```
The study showed significant results [citation needed]. According to research [source],
this approach is effective.
```
**Expected:** Should detect `broken-citation` pattern (2 matches)

### Test Case 3: Cultural ClichÃ©s
```
This tradition left a profound legacy that continues today. It's worth mentioning that
the rich cultural heritage stands as a testament to their achievements.
```
**Expected:** Should detect `profound-legacy`, `worth-mentioning`, `cultural-cliche`,
and `significance-statement` patterns

### Test Case 4: Title Case Headings
```markdown
# The Complete Guide To Modern Development

## Best Practices For Writing Clean Code

### Understanding The Fundamentals Of Programming
```
**Expected:** Should detect `title-case-heading` pattern (3 matches)

### Test Case 5: Em-Dash Spam
```
The system is fastâ€”really fastâ€”incredibly fastâ€”and reliable too.
```
**Expected:** Should detect `em-dash-spam` pattern (1 match)

## Performance Impact

### Estimated Performance:
- **Regex Compilation**: Negligible (patterns pre-compiled at initialization)
- **Runtime Impact**: <1ms additional processing time
- **Memory**: ~2KB additional pattern definitions

### Measured Performance (should remain):
- Target: <50ms CPU time per request âœ…
- Typical: 20-40ms for 1000-word text âœ…

---

## Migration Notes

### For Existing Deployments:
1. No breaking changes
2. No database migrations required (stateless)
3. Simply deploy updated code
4. Version number in responses will automatically update to 1.1.0

### For API Consumers:
- API response format unchanged
- New patterns will appear in `patterns_detected` array
- `metadata.pattern_engine_version` will show `1.1.0`

---

## Future Enhancements

Potential additional patterns to consider:

1. **rule-of-three-lists** - Lists with exactly 3 items (common AI pattern)
2. **quote-mixing** - Mixed straight and curly quotes
3. **excessive-bold** - >10% of text in bold formatting
4. **transition-words** - Overuse of "moreover", "furthermore", "additionally"
5. **semantic-redundancy** - Repetitive phrasing variations
